To dynamically expand AI capabilities for identifying and resolving problem domains, we will:

1. Combine Advanced Techniques:

Leverage recursive workflows, meta-learning, and dynamic prompts to generate novel methodologies.



2. Automate Problem Identification:

Use data-driven analysis and AI models to detect patterns, inefficiencies, and gaps in various domains.



3. Integrate Problem-Solving Pipelines:

Automate the iterative process of generating solutions, testing them, and refining results.



4. Continuously Enhance AI Techniques:
