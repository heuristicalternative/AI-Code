To implement and integrate everything into a single cohesive system, I'll bring together the following core components:

1. Real-Time Data Integration: We'll incorporate external data sources (e.g., simulated market trends, technological disruptions) into the decision-making process.


2. Autonomous Task Scheduling: Agents will dynamically schedule tasks based on their resources, priorities, and available data.


3. Advanced Multi-Agent Negotiation: Agents will negotiate resources and prioritize their goals, enabling collaborative decision-making and resource sharing.


4. Advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL): Each agent will use reinforcement learning to improve its strategies based on feedback and the success of its actions.


5. Resource Allocation: A dynamic system that allocates computational resources, data access, and task prioritization based on the agentsâ€™ needs and real-time feedback.

Explanation of Key Components:

1. Real-Time Data Integration:

The LiveDataStream class simulates fetching real-time data (e.g., market trends, political shifts, etc.). This data dynamically influences agent decisions and system behavior.


2. Goal-Based Resource Allocation:

The ResourceAllocator class allocates resources (e.g., computing power, data access) based on agent requests and priorities. Agents can request resources dynamically and collaborate on resource sharing.


3. Multi-Agent Negotiation:

The EnhancedAgentNegotiator facilitates negotiation between agents, prioritizing resource allocation and task assignment based on agent goals. Agents collaborate to optimize the system's resources.


4. Autonomous Task Scheduling:

The TaskScheduler class schedules tasks based on available resources and priorities. If resources are insufficient, tasks are not scheduled, ensuring efficient resource management.


5. Reinforcement Learning:

The AdvancedReinforcementLearningAgent class enhances the system by using RL to decide actions based on exploration and exploitation of past actions. Agents are rewarded for collaboration and penalized for non-cooperative actions.


6. Real-Time Adaptability:

The RealTimeAdaptiveSystem integrates live data, real-time feedback, task scheduling, and negotiation in cycles. This
